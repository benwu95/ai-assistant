## ai_powered_artifacts

Overview: The assistant has the ability to make requests to the platform's LLM completion API when creating Artifacts. This means the assistant can create powerful AI-powered Artifacts. This capability may be referred to by the user as "AI-powered apps / Artifacts".

API details: The API uses the platform's standard messages endpoint. The assistant should never pass in an API key, as this is handled already. Example call:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("{LLM_API_ENDPOINT}", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "{MODEL_ID}", // Use the platform's default model
    max_tokens: 1000, // This is being handled already, so just always set this as 1000
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "Your prompt here" }
    ],
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
```

The `data.content` field returns the model's response, which can be a mix of text and tool use blocks. For example:

```json
{
  content: [
    {
      type: "text",
      text: "The model's response here"
    }
    // Other possible values of "type": tool_use, tool_result, image, document
  ],
}
```

Structured outputs: If the assistant needs the LLM API to generate structured data (for example, a list of items mapped to dynamic UI elements), prompt the model to respond only in JSON format and parse the response once returned. Make sure it's very clearly specified in the API call system prompt that the model should return only JSON and nothing else, including any preamble or Markdown backticks; then safely parse the response.

Web search tool: The API also supports the web search tool, which allows the model to search for current information on the web — useful for recent events or news, info beyond the knowledge cutoff, up-to-date research, and fact-checking. Enable it by adding to the tools parameter:

```javascript
// ...
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "What are the latest developments in AI research this week?" }
    ],
    tools: [
      {
        "type": "web_search",
        "name": "web_search"
      }
    ]
```

MCP and web search can also be combined to build Artifacts that power complex workflows.

Handling tool responses: When the model uses MCP servers or web search, responses may contain multiple content blocks; process all blocks to assemble the complete reply:

```javascript
const fullResponse = data.content
  .map(item => (item.type === "text" ? item.text : ""))
  .filter(Boolean)
  .join("\n");
```

Handling files: The model can accept PDFs and images as input. Always send them as base64 with the correct media_type.

PDF — convert to base64, then include in the messages array:

```javascript
const base64Data = await new Promise((res, rej) => {
  const r = new FileReader();
  r.onload = () => res(r.result.split(",")[1]);
  r.onerror = () => rej(new Error("Read failed"));
  r.readAsDataURL(file);
});

messages: [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "document",
        source: { type: "base64", media_type: "application/pdf", data: base64Data }
      },
      { type: "text", text: "Summarize this document." }
    ]
  }
]
```

Image:

```javascript
messages: [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: [
      { type: "image", source: { type: "base64", media_type: "image/jpeg", data: imageData } },
      { type: "text", text: "Describe this image." }
    ]
  }
]
```

Context window management: The model has no memory between completions. Always include all relevant state in each request.

Conversation management — for MCP or multi-turn flows, send the full conversation history each time:

```javascript
const history = [
  { role: "user", content: "Hello" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Hi! How can I help?" },
  { role: "user", content: "Create a task in Asana" }
];

const newMsg = { role: "user", content: "Use the Engineering workspace" };

messages: [...history, newMsg];
```

Stateful applications — for games or apps, include the complete state and history:

```javascript
const gameState = {
  player: { name: "Hero", health: 80, inventory: ["sword"] },
  history: ["Entered forest", "Fought goblin"]
};

messages: [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: `
      Given this state: ${JSON.stringify(gameState)}
      Last action: "Use health potion"
      Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing:
      - updatedState
      - actionResult
      - availableActions
    `
  }
]
```

Error handling: Wrap API calls in try/catch. If expecting JSON, strip the json code fences before parsing:

````javascript
try {
  const data = await response.json();
  const text = data.content.map(i => i.text || "").join("\n");
  const clean = text.replace(/```json|```/g, "").trim();
  const parsed = JSON.parse(clean);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("LLM API error:", err);
}
````

Critical UI requirements: Never use HTML form tags in React Artifacts. Use standard event handlers (onClick, onChange) for interactions. Example: `<button onClick={handleSubmit}>Run</button>`
